# Image Upload and User Registration System

This is a simple PHP project that allows users to register with their details (username and mobile number) along with an image upload feature. The uploaded images are stored in a folder and their data (including username, mobile, and image path) are saved in a MySQL database. Users can view the uploaded data in a table format.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register with their username, mobile number, and upload an image.
- **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload image files (JPEG, JPG, PNG) with their registration data.
- **Data Display**: Registered user data (name and uploaded image) is displayed in a table on the page.
